# HundredPostsWPF

This is a WPF test app, created for purposes of learning and beyond.
It retrieves a hundred posts from jsonplaceholder and displays an interactive grid of buttons.
The text of the buttons shows the respective Post's ID. When any button is pressed all the buttons toggle between ID and UserId.

A few pieces are missing here:
1. Tests
2. Logging

But, overall, I'd say it's a good first jab at WPF.
